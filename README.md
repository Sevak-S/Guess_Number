# Guess_Number
This is a game about guess number. You can play with a computer or human. Human keep number and computer has to guess the number and vice-versa.
The game is based on algorithm of binary search.

There are two functions ***user_guess_number(range)*** and ***computer_guess_number(range)***.
The function ***user_guess_number(range)*** sets a range of numbers in the code, then the computer will guess a number within this range and the User tries to please.
The user writes a number in the console and presses enter, if it is correct, congratulations, if not, the computer responds with a dialed number less or more.
So on until you're satisfied.
The function ***computer_guess_number(range)*** sets a range of numbers in the code, and the computer starts guessing.
Again in the console the computer writes a number and the user answers with letters **too high (H)**, **too low (L)**, or **correct (C)**
until the computer guesses the correct number.

I used the library ***Random***
